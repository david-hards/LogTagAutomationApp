TODO:

- Add dropbox logic for loggers in ucStartTest (DONE)
- Default username not writing to JSON in FileController
- ReadLastLoggedInDate when app loads
- Load tests when app loads (DONE)
- Add Logger subtypes with temp parameters or remove min and max temp entirely as they arent needed?
- Remove top line of Dostmann before processing
- When create test page comes up, empty all fields if possible without fucking the designer again
- !!!!!!Add dostmann array to test!!!!!! (DONE)
- Check if other default settings are needed, ie lastLoggedIn
- Be careful to wipe old data when going back pages etc, to avoid duplicating loggers in lists, readings etc
- Add completed test to TestController Completed tests
- Fix persistence issues around going back, then reopening the same window and the same data still being displayed
- When installed on a new pc will it default to david/desktop etc, or should i change it to working folder
- Change Searches in search controller to be LIKE instead of exact

COULD TODO:
- Add option to upload rather than drag and drop dostmann / LTD files (NOT NEEDED)
- Switch labels to MessageBoxes (DONE)

DRAWBACKS:
- Can't test multiple models at the same time, too much entanglement imo
